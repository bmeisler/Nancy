# Nancy
Contains several versions of the Nancy cut-up method, originally posted here:

http://sensitiveskinmagazine.com/william-s-burroughs-nancy-comics-and-the-cut-up-method-bernard-meisler/

Nancy.html plays random-image.js, which is the same version that's on the sensitive skin site - press the button and
get four random images. This uses the canvas context to draw.

Nancy_dnd.html is the same, only now you can drag and drop the images to change the order; this uses random-image_dnd.js,
which uses EaselJS to draw bitmaps and make them drag and droppable.

I'm still working on random-image_dnd_pop.js, which will make the images "pop" neatly into place when
you drop one on another.
